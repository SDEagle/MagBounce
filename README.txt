MagBounce is a platform/puzzle/sidescroll game about magnetism.

It was developed within 48h (Version 0.1) for the GameJam Contest of GPN11 (https://entropia.de/GPN11) by the MOSDEV Team.

It is written in Java and uses the Slick Library (which uses the LWJGL Library)
To compile you will need those.
To run you have to get the lwjgl natives (provided with Slick) and pass the path to them as a VM Option (-Djava.library.path="yourpath" eg. MagBounce/lib/native/linux)
Furthermore you have to get some levels and the media data, which are available as a download. Put the folders inside the data-archive in the same folder as your src directory is.

Binaries for windows and linux are now available under Downloads!
