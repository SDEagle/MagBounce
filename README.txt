MagBounce is a platform/puzzle/sidescroll game about magnetism.

It was developed within 48h (Version 0.1) for the GameJam Contest of GPN11 (https://entropia.de/GPN11) by the MOSDEV Team.

It is written in Java and uses the Slick Library (which uses the LWJGL Library)
To compile you will need those.
To run you have to get the lwjgl natives (provided with Slick) and pass the path to them as a VM Option (-Djava.library.path="yourpath" eg. MagBounce/lib/native/linux)
Furthermore you have to get some levels and the media data, which will be available somewhere in the future.

Binaries will also be provided in the future.
